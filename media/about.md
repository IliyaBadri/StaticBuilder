I'm a self-taught programmer and game developer.

I have mastered programming in many languages and frameworks and I ne have worked on many different projects which needed advanced problem solving skills.

## My journey

I have started my journey as a Unity game developer. I have made my first game with the help of an article in 2018.

Also the first programming language that I got familiar with was C#, which was required for programming inside Unity engine. Still, programming was very hard for me back then, and I couldn't even write a line of code on my own.

During the Covid pandemic, I've got plenty of time to spend on programming. I learned Node.js which was a lot easier than C#. Then I started learning web development. I got familiar with HTML and CSS which was pretty exciting. It finally felt like I'm making some progress.

This was when I got my first job. I was hired by a small business and my job was to create a website for them. Also the whole networking and IT engineering was my duty to take care of. Since I was all by my own, it took three months to build that website.

After the job ended I started exploring more about programming and different areas of it. I knew web development was not enough for me.

I always wanted to know how applications work and what goes on behind the scenes. I realized I needed a different framework and programming language to start my software engineering journey.

Some of my close friends said I need to learn Python to learn software engineering. And so I did. I read some articles and watched some youtube videos. I made my first app with TKinter and published it to github which was a huge progress for me.

But soon after I realized that python isn't going to cut it. The GUI was ugly and it would get flagged by anti-virus softwares (Thanks to pyinstaller).

Also I found out that object-oriented programming languages are generally a better option for bigger projects. (I hated Python)

I started searching for something more powerfull that can also run cross-platform. There were many options like React native and Flutter. But still I wanted something better and more low level.

Since I had a background in C#, I wondered if it can run cross-platform or not (Which it could). This was when I started really learning C#. I made a .NET MAUI project which was a pretty new framework.

I created my first two cross-platform apps using .NET MAUI and published them to github.

I also enchanced my web development skills and started working on APIs and advanced concepts of it. I also managed to create this website.

Over time I learned how to use Git better. I started using branches to manage my workflow. This allowed me to build a project that I've had in my mind for a long time. So I built EnLaunch. It took a long amount of time.

Well it was a Windows Forms application and managing that workflow all by myself, alongside testing the launcher for bugs, was a pretty long process for me as a solo dev. I tried to get feedback from others and fix it as best as I can. I published three releases and then decided to stop.

Maybe later I would work on it again.

I had to face it. I didn't know how these programming languages work behind the scene. And I had to face with a low level language like C++ sooner or later. So, just for doing some experiment, I started working on GraphC. I learned how to make a bitmap image by processing pixels byte by byte. It was a different experience. It was important to know that even though I'm not doing much, I have full control over what I do. (I also realized how fast Hash Maps are!)

I wanted to resume my game dev path again. But as the time of this writing, Unity became pretty limiting for its free users. And I just wanted to use an open-source software to develop my game.

Since I like 3D games I chose Godot. It supported C# which was pretty nice and it was just like Unity in some ways. It lacked some features though. So I had to learn Blender too. (For animations and stuff)

Right now I'm working on my game named Tenant. It's a simple singleplayer fps game. But, It's enough to make me underestand the basics of game dev.
